### TURN 3 — Product Type + Colours (dropdowns)

After the codebase question is resolved, show these four dropdowns together:

**Q2** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "What kind of product are you building?"
- `Web app`
- `Mobile app`
- `Web + Mobile`
- `Desktop app`
- `Something else — I'll describe`

**Q3** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Primary brand colour?"
- `I'll paste a hex code (e.g. #3B82F6)`
- `Blue — confident, trustworthy (e.g. #2563EB)`
- `Green — growth, health, success (e.g. #16A34A)`
- `Purple — premium, creative (e.g. #7C3AED)`
- `Orange — energetic, friendly (e.g. #EA580C)`
- `Red — bold, urgent (e.g. #DC2626)`
- `Custom — I'll describe`

**Q4** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Secondary / accent colour direction?"
- `Complementary — opposite on the colour wheel (high contrast, energetic)`
- `Analogous — adjacent tones (harmonious, cohesive)`
- `Neutral accent — muted, desaturated (professional, calm)`
- `Monochromatic — lighter/darker tint of primary (minimal)`
- `Custom — I'll provide the hex`

**Q5** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Neutral / grey palette style?"
- `Cool grey / blue-grey (slight blue tint — e.g. Tailwind Slate)`
- `Warm grey / sand (slight yellow-beige tint — e.g. Tailwind Stone)`
- `Pure neutral grey (no tint — e.g. Tailwind Gray)`
- `Custom — I'll describe`

> If Q3 answer is "I'll paste a hex code" or Q4 is "Custom", ask for the hex as a follow-up open-text question before continuing.

---

### TURN 4 — Colour Modes + Architecture

**Q6** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Colour modes?"
- `Light only`
- `Dark only`
- `Both light and dark`

**Q7** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Token layer architecture?"
- `1-layer — Primitives + Typography + optional collections. Smallest system. Good for prototypes or tiny teams.`
- `2-layer — Primitives + Theme + Typography + optional. Standard for most products.`
- `3-layer — Primitives + Theme + Component Colors + Typography + optional. Per-component colour tokens. Includes Component Dimensions automatically.`
- `4-layer — Primitives + Theme + Semantic + Component Colors + Typography + optional. Full enterprise depth. Includes Component Dimensions automatically.`

> ARCHITECTURE NOTE: Component Colors AND Component Dimensions are automatically included in 3-layer and 4-layer. Do NOT ask the user again if they want these collections when they have already chosen 3 or 4 layer.

---

### TURN 5 — Optional Collections

Show all optional collection questions as a batch. The Responsive collection is always included (it is mandatory — Typography and Component Dimensions both require it). Only ask about the truly optional ones:

**Q8** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Density collection? Controls padding + gap across compact / comfortable / spacious modes."
- `Yes — include Density`
- `No — use fixed spacing values`

**Q9** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Effects collection? Shadow and blur tokens with structured aliasing."
- `Yes — include Effects`
- `No`

**Q10** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Layout collection? Grid column/margin/gutter specs per breakpoint (xs → xxl)."
- `Yes — include Layout`
- `No`

**Q11** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Any additional custom collections? (e.g. Motion, Z-index, Elevation)"
- `No — that's everything`
- `Yes — I'll describe`

> If Q11 is "Yes", ask follow-up: "Describe each custom collection — name, what kind of tokens it contains, and any modes it needs."

---

### TURN 6 — Component Details
*(Only show if architecture is 3-layer or 4-layer)*

**Q12** *(open text)*: "Which components need dedicated colour tokens in Component Colors?

Note: icon, container, and divider are always included.

Component Colors will be split into two groups:
- **Interactive** — components with multiple states (default/hover/pressed/disabled): button, input, checkbox, radio, toggle, switch, tooltip, dropdown
- **Static** — components with fewer/no interaction states: card, modal, badge, tag, navbar, sidebar, table, avatar, alert, banner, chip, progress

List the components you need — I'll assign each to the correct group."

Wait for the response. Then show:

**Q13** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "How should Component Colors be organised?"
- `Split — interactive (button, input, toggle…) vs non-interactive (card, badge, avatar…)`
- `Flat — all components at the same level`
- `Custom — I'll describe my grouping`

**Q14** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Icon token needs?"
- `Fill + stroke + duotone — standard icons with secondary path support`
- `Fill + stroke + duotone + background — icons inside a coloured container (filled icon buttons, icon chips)`
- `Fill + stroke only — no duotone, no background`

---

### TURN 7 — Typography + Fonts

**Q15** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Typography scale?"
- `Standard 12 roles — display, heading, subheading, body-lg, body, body-sm, label-lg, label, label-sm, caption, overline, code`
- `Extended 16+ roles — adds display-sm, heading-sm, heading-lg, body-strong, numeric/tabular`
- `Custom — I'll describe the roles I need`

**Q16** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Fonts?"
- `Inter for everything (placeholder — easy to swap in Figma later)`
- `Specify now — I'll type the font names`
- `System font stack`

> If "Specify now": ask open-text — "Primary font (body text)? Display/heading font (if different)? Monospace font for code (optional)?" — wait for response before continuing.

---

### TURN 8 — Naming + Code Syntax

**Q17** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Token code syntax format?"
- `CSS custom properties — e.g. --color-button-primary-background`
- `Tailwind / kebab-case — e.g. color-button-primary-background`
- `JavaScript camelCase — e.g. colorButtonPrimaryBackground`
- `Android / XML underscore — e.g. color_button_primary_background`
- `iOS / Swift PascalCase — e.g. ColorButtonPrimaryBackground`
- `Custom format — I'll describe`

**Q18** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "Token naming convention?"
- `Role-based — color.surface.primary / color.text.secondary`
- `Component-first — color.button.secondary.default.background`
- `Material Design — color.surface / color.on-surface / color.surface-variant`
- `IBM Carbon — color.background / color.layer-01 / color.text-primary`
- `Custom — I'll describe`

---

### TURN 9 — Final Options

**Q19** *(ask_user_input — single_select)*: "High-contrast accessibility mode (WCAG AAA)?"
- `Yes — add high-contrast mode`
- `No`

**Q20** *(open text)*: "Any other requirements — specific token values, tokens to avoid, existing conventions to match, or anything else? (leave blank to proceed)"

Wait for response. If the user describes something requiring follow-up (e.g. a custom collection, a non-standard architecture), ask clarifying questions before proceeding to Phase 2.

---

## PHASE 2 — CONFIRM ARCHITECTURE

Show this summary before generating anything:

```
ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY
═══════════════════════════════════════════
Brand:      {name}
Product:    {type}
Layer:      {1/2/3/4}-layer

Collections — import in this exact order:
  1.  Primitives             always
  2.  Theme                  always         | {modes}
  3.  Semantic               4-layer only
  4.  Responsive             always         | mobile, tablet, desktop
  5.  Density                {yes/no}       | compact, comfortable, spacious
  6.  Layout                 {yes/no}       | xs→xxl
  7.  Effects                {yes/no}       | (single mode)
  8.  Typography             always         | (single mode)
  9.  Component Colors       3-layer+       | (single mode)
  10. Component Dimensions   3-layer+       | (single mode)
  {custom collections}

Colours:       Primary {hex/name}, Secondary {direction}, Neutral {style}
Fonts:         {specified / "Inter (placeholder)"}
Type scale:    {Standard 12 / Extended 16+ / Custom}
Naming:        {convention}
Code syntax:   {format}
Components:    {list or N/A}
Icon tokens:   {fill+stroke+duotone / +background / basic}
CC split:      {split / flat / N/A}
High contrast: {yes/no}
```

Ask using ask_user_input: `Yes — generate everything` / `Change something first`

**Do not generate a single token until the user confirms.**

---

## PHASE 3 — GENERATION

Read ALL 5 reference files before writing any JSON. 

**OUTPUT CONSTRAINT CRITICAL RULE:**
You must ONLY output valid `.zip` files containing the structured JSON. NEVER output `.skill` files or dump massive scripts to the user. Do not wrap the output in proprietary skill abstractions.

> **CRITICAL PERFORMANCE RULE:** Do NOT attempt to write one giant script or generate all ZIP files in a single turn. Generating 700+ tokens at once will cause you to time out and fail. 
> You must strictly break the generation across multiple turns as instructed below. You must stop generating and wait for the user to reply "Next" before proceeding to the next turn. Do not write extensive `<thinking>` blocks. Execute immediately.

> **ALIAS INTEGRITY RULE — ZERO BROKEN REFERENCES:** Every alias in a downstream collection (Theme, Responsive, Density, Effects, Typography, Semantic, Component Colors, Component Dimensions) MUST point to a token that already exists in its parent collection. If a downstream token needs a Primitive value that wasn't generated yet, you MUST add that token to Primitives first. Never ship a ZIP containing an alias whose target does not exist — Figma will silently fail on import.

---

### TURN A — Core Foundations
**Before writing Primitives:** Plan all downstream alias targets (Theme, Responsive, Density, Effects, Typography, Components). Backfill any missing primitive tokens so every future alias has a valid target. Generate Primitives LAST-MILE — after planning all downstream values, add any missing primitive tokens before writing the ZIP.

Generate and output the ZIP files for these collections ONLY:
1. **Primitives:** full colour palette + alpha variants (Razorpay flat-sibling pattern) + all font tokens under `font/` group + layout primitive values + spacing + shadow geometry + borderWidth (0.3/0.5/0.8/1/2/4) + radius + blur
2. **Theme:** every surface/text/border/interactive/feedback/overlay group, all states + shadow colour tokens

*Stop here. Provide the ZIPs and explicitly tell the user: "Type **Next** to generate structural collections (Responsive, Density, Layout, Effects)."*

---

### TURN B — Structural Collections
*(Wait for user to type "Next")*

Generate and output the ZIP files for these collections ONLY:
1. **Responsive:** all font size/lineHeight/letterSpacing roles × 3 breakpoints + radius × 3 breakpoints + borderWidth × 3 breakpoints
2. **Density:** padding (x/y/top/bottom/left/right only — 6 directional tokens, values up to 64px at spacious) + gap (xs/sm/md/lg/xl/2xl/3xl/4xl — up to 128px at spacious) × 3 modes
3. **Layout:** Layout structural variables (if selected)
4. **Effects:** shadow sm/md/lg/xl (colour → Theme, geometry → Primitives) + blur tokens

*Stop here. Provide the ZIPs and explicitly tell the user: "Type **Next** to generate the final component and semantic collections."*

---

### TURN C — Components & Semantics
*(Wait for user to type "Next")*

Generate and output the ZIP files for these collections ONLY:
1. **Typography:** every role × 5 properties (fontSize/lineHeight/letterSpacing → Responsive; fontFamily/fontWeight → Primitives) + colour tokens → Theme
2. **Semantic (if applicable):** as per 4-layer architecture rules
3. **Component Colors:** every component × every variant × every state × every layer + icon duotone tokens
4. **Component Dimensions:** all padding/gap (→ Density) + all radius/borderWidth (→ Responsive)

*Stop here. Provide the ZIPs and automatically proceed to Turn D.*

---

### Token count reporting (TURN D)

After delivering Turn C ZIPs, report a count table to the user so they can cross-check the import. Count **unique token paths** (one token = one line item in Figma's variable panel, regardless of how many modes it has). Do not multiply by mode count.

### Mode file naming (critical — no "Value" names)
- Primitives: `primitives.tokens.json` with `"modeName": "primitives"`
- Typography: `typography.tokens.json` with `"modeName": "typography"`
- Effects: `effects.tokens.json` with `"modeName": "effects"`
- Semantic: `semantic.tokens.json` with `"modeName": "semantic"`
- Component Colors: `component-colors.tokens.json` with `"modeName": "component-colors"`
- Component Dimensions: `component-dimensions.tokens.json` with `"modeName": "component-dimensions"`
- All other collections use their natural mode names (light, dark, mobile, compact etc.)

### Default modes
- Theme: light is default
- Responsive: mobile is default
- Density: comfortable is default

Run the validation checklist from `references/03-json-format.md` before finalising each ZIP.

### Token count reporting — required after generation

After generating all ZIPs, report a count table to the user so they can cross-check the import. Count **unique token paths** (one token = one line item in Figma's variable panel, regardless of how many modes it has). Do not multiply by mode count.

Example format:
```
TOKENS GENERATED
══════════════════════════════════
Collection          Tokens
──────────────────────────────────
Primitives          142
Theme               87
Responsive          54
Density             14
Layout              5
Effects             18
Typography          72
Semantic            48       (4-layer only)
Component Colors    186
Component Dimensions 28
──────────────────────────────────
Total               654
══════════════════════════════════
```
Tell the user: "These counts reflect unique tokens (one per row in Figma), not multiplied by modes."
